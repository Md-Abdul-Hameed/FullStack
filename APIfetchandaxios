Two methods to fetch apis 
1.fetch and 2. axios


1.fetch example
    let response = await fetch(url);//->response will get a json file
    let data = await response.json()//->The json() method of the Response interface takes a Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.


2.axios example
    let response = await axios(url).data
