//HOF -> a function that returns or accepts a function

//forEach,map,filter,reduce,polyfill,sort->every HOF returns a new array and does not mutate the old array(Immutable)
//interview questions -> implement any of these above

//forEach does not returns anything but map does
//for in and for of 
//for in -> normal object and iterable -> gives keys
//for of -> only iterable -> gives values
